# For Statements
# The for statements in python differs a bit from C. Python for statements iterate over the items of any sequence (a list of string) in order that they appear in the sequence.
# The range function. I you need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the buit in function range() comes in handy, it generates arithmetic progressions

for i in range(8):
    print(i)

# In most cases its convenient to use the enumerate() function.
